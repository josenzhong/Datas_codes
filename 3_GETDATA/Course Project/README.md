## Functionality of ```run_analysis.R```:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Implementation of ```run_analysis.R```
* Require ```reshapre2``` and ```data.table``` librareis.
* Load both test and train data
* Load the features and activity labels.
* Extract the mean and standard deviation column names and data.
* Process the data. There are two parts processing test and train data respectively.
* Merge data set.
